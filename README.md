**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game. 

Submitted by: **Om Pathak**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- We can make the game more interesting by adding more buttons as well as making it a bit more complicated by making the sounds go faster.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not really any outside resources to help complete my submission. All I used was codepath's guide. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was definitely adding the new button and the css part. The jscript was also new to me but the synax was very similar to languages that I know (Java and Python), so I caught up on that pretty easily. The code in the js file also gave me some errors when I wrote it by myself. Then, I used codepath's guide to help me out. The html/css files had to be edited as I wanted to change the layout of the buttons as well as a new button. So, I looke at the previous code and based my new fixes off of that. I used the CSS links to search for specific button properties that could be implemented. Then, I used those properties to make the game a bit different. The html file was also edited based on codepath's guide. The hints at the bottom of the page really helped me to make things the way I wanted them to be. Furthermore, I implemented some of the methods using codepath's guide as well to help me out with the submission. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing the submission, I definitely have questions about how web development can be used to create some really fun and useful things. I always thought about web development as something that is used to build regular sites using jscript and html/css for styling. I want to know more about the scope of web development. I want to learn how we can use web development to create something that is not only a functional site, but also something that people want to go to every morning. Moreover, I also want to know how I can use different frameworks to create different types of applications. The MEAN stack is very popular right now and I want to understand and use the functionality for each framework to build a successful web application. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I woudl definitely want to make this game more interesting by changing up the UI. It does not look pretty right now or interesting. So I would spend a good amount of time on UI. As the name suggests, it is a game that tests your memory. The sound game is a mini-game. I would add a dashboard where the user can play numerous memory games. Some games would be with lights, some with numbers, some with sounds, some with counting cards (not illegal unless in a casino) and the famous matching the card game. The site would help the user sharpen his/her memory skills and also have fun at the same time. This application would definitely be popular with kids after I add these additioanl features. They could also use this site for educational purposes.
